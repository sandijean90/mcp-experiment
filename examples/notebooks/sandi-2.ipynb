The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) provides a comprehensive list of services covered by Medicare, including their respective reimbursement rates. However, the actual reimbursement can vary based on the geographical location and specific policies set by the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) responsible for that region.', 'score': 0.8260130654488518, 'raw_content': \"CPT Code 90658\\n\\nCPT code 90658 is a code used to identify the administration of the IIV3 vaccine, specifically a 0.5 ml intramuscular injection.\\n\\nBoost patient experience and your bottom line by automating patient cost estimates, payer underpayment detection, and contract optimization in one place.\\n\\nWhat is CPT Code 90658\\n\\nCPT code 90658 is used to describe the administration of the trivalent influenza vaccine, which is a split-virus vaccine given in a 0.5 ml dose via intramuscular injection. This code is specifically utilized for billing purposes when healthcare providers administer this type of flu vaccine to patients. The trivalent formulation typically includes three strains of the influenza virus, selected based on predictions of which strains will be most prevalent during the upcoming flu season. This code helps ensure accurate documentation and reimbursement for the vaccine's administration in a clinical setting.\\n\\nDoes CPT 90658 Need a Modifier?\\n\\nFor CPT code 90658, which pertains to the administration of the influenza virus vaccine, trivalent (IIV3), split virus, 0.5 ml, intramuscular, the following modifiers may be applicable:\\n\\n1. Modifier 25: Significant, Separately Identifiable Evaluation and Management Service by the Same Physician on the Same Day of the Procedure or Other Service. This modifier is used when a significant, separately identifiable evaluation and management (E/M) service is performed by the same physician on the same day as the vaccine administration.\\n\\n2. Modifier 59: Distinct Procedural Service. This modifier is used to indicate that a procedure or service was distinct or independent from other services performed on the same day. It may be applicable if the vaccine administration is performed in conjunction with other procedures that are not typically reported together.\\n\\n3. Modifier 76: Repeat Procedure or Service by Same Physician or Other Qualified Health Care Professional. This modifier is used if the vaccine is administered more than once on the same day by the same provider, which is uncommon but possible in certain clinical scenarios.\\n\\n4. Modifier 77: Repeat Procedure by Another Physician or Other Qualified Health Care Professional. This modifier is used if the vaccine is administered more than once on the same day by a different provider.\\n\\n5. Modifier 95: Synchronous Telemedicine Service Rendered via a Real-Time Interactive Audio and Video Telecommunications System. While typically not applicable to vaccine administration, this modifier might be relevant if the vaccine administration is part of a telehealth visit where counseling or other services are provided.\\n\\n6. Modifier SL: State Supplied Vaccine. This modifier is used when the vaccine is supplied by the state, indicating that the provider did not incur the cost of the vaccine.\\n\\nThese modifiers help ensure accurate billing and reimbursement by providing additional context for the services rendered. It's important to verify payer-specific guidelines, as the applicability of modifiers can vary.\\n\\nCPT Code 90658 Medicare Reimbursement\\n\\nCPT code 90658, which is associated with a specific medical service, is generally reimbursed by Medicare, but this is contingent upon several factors. The Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) provides a comprehensive list of services covered by Medicare, including their respective reimbursement rates. However, the actual reimbursement can vary based on the geographical location and specific policies set by the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) responsible for that region.\\n\\nEach MAC has the authority to interpret national Medicare policies and may have additional local coverage determinations that affect whether and how a particular CPT code, such as 90658, is reimbursed. Therefore, healthcare providers should verify with their local MAC to ensure that CPT code 90658 is covered and understand any specific billing requirements or limitations that may apply.\\n\\nAre You Being Underpaid for 90658 CPT Code?\\n\\nDiscover how MD Clarity's RevFind software can enhance your revenue cycle management by accurately reading your contracts and pinpointing underpayments down to the CPT code level, including specific codes like 90658.

The overview page is a great starting place with some general information. The FAQ sheet also provides additional basic information: https://www.cms.gov/MLNProducts/downloads/MSP_Fact_Sheet.pdf. There are also SEVERAL manuals available on the CMS website for Medicare Secondary Payer rules but basicly when Medicare is secondary you will need to send them the apprpriate G code.

The only “insurance” this effects is Medicare. The Q codes should not be billed to a commercial insurance company. Usually insurance covers flu shots but with people and employers choosing cheaper health insurance policies to save money we have seen more flu shots going towards insurance deductibles.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nANNA\\nNovember 20, 2011 at 12:37 am\\nThank you Manny, your reply to questions regarding Q codes are very clear and very well understood.

Thank you.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nNovember 28, 2011 at 2:47 pm\\nAnna you will need to do lots of research. This is what I would do:\\n1. Get on Google and start searching on how to bill for dialysis. Now you will need to make sure that the information is correct because there is a lot of info that may not be right on the web.\\n2. Go to insurance company websites and see if they information on how they want dialysis billed. This may vary from insurance company to insurance company so check them all out.\\n3. Next go to the American Society of Nephrology website at http://www.asn-online.org/ and see if they have any articles on billing.\\nThant should get you started.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndainapeter\\nOctober 21, 2011 at 7:28 am\\nIf you’re not using HCPCS codes correctly, get your pen ready for major paybacks. With HCPCS codes making the top error reporting lists, be prepared for auditors to hone in on your equipment and supply coding. Penalties for double billing on supply and drug codes can run into the hundreds of thousands.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nJulia\\nOctober 18, 2011 at 3:18 pm\\nDo the Q codes require us to bill with a NDC code? My billing system is asking for one, I put the NDC code in and he claims were returned by medicare stating NDC code invalid.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nOctober 18, 2011 at 8:48 pm\\nJulia we send ours in with the NDC number. There is a specific format that you must follow when you put it into your computer system. NDCs are in a 11-digit format and are usually seen in a 5-4-2 format. For example: 99999-9999-99. Sometimes, just to confuse things I believe, they are in 10-digit formats. Before entering the number into your computer system you must convert it to an 11-digit NDC.\\nUse the following methodology to convert your NDCs from 10-digits to 11-digits:\\nIf 10-digit NDC format is: 4-4-2 9999-9999-99\\nThen add a zero (0) in: 1st position 09999-9999-99\\nReport NDC as: 09999999999\\nIf 10-digit NDC format is: 5-3-2 99999-999-99\\nThen add a zero (0) in: 6th position 99999-0999-99\\nReport NDC as: 99999099999\\nIf 10-digit NDC format is: 5-4-1 99999-9999-9\\nThen add a zero (0) in: 10th position 99999-9999-09\\nReport NDC as: 99999999909\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nJulia\\nOctober 19, 2011 at 5:39 pm\\nThank You!!!\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nOctober 19, 2011 at 9:08 pm\\nYou are welcome!

I bill most codes w/the Medicare required QW separately as the regulation states, for the Medicare patients he does NOT Accept assignment on. My confusion is…do I need a modifier 25 for the flu shot because it is a separate procedure from the patient\\'s follow-up Diabetic visits. Do I bill it with the clincial lab codes OR with the E/M codes? PLEASE ADVISE. It is much appreciated.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nOctober 18, 2011 at 9:00 pm\\nAmy, typically the flu shot is never billed with a modifier – neither the -25 nor the –QW modifier. We have submitted claims to Medicare for the Q codes with no modifier and have been paid by our local Medicare carrier. Also the flu shot is typically billed out with the office visits – not the lab, as the flu shot is a vaccine that does not require a test. Additionally the office staff should be billing out for the Administration of the Vaccine G0008.\\nHowever, since you are NOT accepting assignment, that means you are a NON PAR provider. Medicare will not reimburse you and you cannot bill the member because you would not be considered an approved lab and cannot bill the member unless the member signed the appropriate ABN that makes them aware that you are non par and they accept financial responsibility for all charges.\\nThe question that we have for you is , if you are non par and don’t accept assignment why are you billing Medicare in the first place?\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJESS\\nOctober 5, 2011 at 11:33 am\\nWHEN USING THE 90662 WHAT IS THE Q CODE THAT IS NEEDED OR DO WE JUST USE A G CODE FOR THE FLU HIGH DOSE?\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nOctober 18, 2011 at 11:22 pm\\nJess as far as I know there is no Q code that equates to 90662.

One consideration would be how your software and the clearinghouse handles the electronic transaction for Part A vs. Part B claims. All your claims may be setup to automatically go to Part A. You may have to, on a claim by claim basis, send the claims to Part B. There should be a way to do that in your computer system. You should also call your local Medicare carrier for help on where to send the claim and contact your tech support if you have questions on how your computer system is setup to submit your claims.

Your website is very helpful.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez - Med\\nSeptember 14, 2011 at 2:05 am\\nConnie here is what I have come up with. Hope it answers your questions.\\nThe flu vaccine reimbursements are based on 95% of the Average Wholesale Price (AWP). Please refer to this CMS article which explains why there is a variance in reimbursement: http://www.cms.gov/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/MM7234.pdf. Although the article does not discuss “why” there is a difference in the AWP, it does explain how they base their reimbursement. I can only assume that the difference must be based on material or cost from the manufacturer.\\nThe allowable for the G0008 may vary based on location but is about $25. Please check with your local Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) for specific locality reimbursement or you can also check the physician fee schedule for your area: http://www.cms.gov/apps/physician-fee-schedule/license-agreement.aspx\\nIf you are billing for a flu vaccine then no you cannot use the 96372 which is for a therapeutic injection and not for the administration of the influenza vaccination.\\nFor a Medicare patient use the G0008. For a non-Medicare patient use the 90471.\\nAdditional useful links/resources\\nEducational resources:\\nhttp://www.cms.gov/MLNProducts/Downloads/Flu_Products.pdf\\nMedicare Flu billing instructions and introduction of new HCPCS codes:\\nhttp://www.cms.gov/MLNMattersArticles/downloads/MM7234.pdf\\nMedicare Quick Reference guide:\\nhttp://www.cms.gov/MLNProducts/downloads/qr_immun_bill.pdf\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid Vaxmonsky\\nOctober 3, 2011 at 9:48 pm\\nThe difference with the reimbursement rates is that the higher rates correspond to the preservative-free prefilled syringes, which have a higher acquisition cost.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmirna monterrosa\\nAugust 18, 2011 at 10:35 am\\nManny Good morning I have questions, regarding flu shots is cpt 90658 will no longer be used for all other inusurances also?

I would appreciated if you let me know\\nThanks\\nMirna\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez - Med\\nAugust 18, 2011 at 3:37 pm\\nMirna you can use 90658 for commercial insurance companies. For Medicare you would use G0008 for the administration of the flu shot and one of the new Q codes for the vaccine given. The Q code will vary from practice to practice depending on who the manufacturer is of the flu vaccine. For example, if you use Fluzone the you would bill:\\nG0008 Administration of Influenza Vaccine\\nQ2038 Fluzone Vaccine\\nHope this helps.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nKIM\\nSeptember 8, 2011 at 4:25 pm\\nActually you are to use 90662 for the high dose vaccine and use the Q-codes for standard doses.\\nHope that helps.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez - Med\\nSeptember 8, 2011 at 5:58 pm\\nThank you Kim for the additional info. CPT 90662 is for the Fluzone High-Dose Vaccine which has 4 times the antigen of the regular vaccine. It was specifically developed for people 65 years of age and older to generate a bigger immune response to better protect them from the flu. The Medicare reimbursement is around $29 but check with your local Medicare carrier.\\nKeep those comments coming Kim!\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmber\\nOctober 21, 2011 at 7:46 pm\\nTricare states that cpt code 90658 is currently not priced by them. If this code is used for billing, the claim must be billed with the NDC rate.\\nI talked to a rep today and he wasn\\'t sure but thought they may go back and audit all 90658 from January 1, 2011 and try and recoup their payments.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nOctober 21, 2011 at 8:33 pm\\nI just read a notice on a Tricare website dated October 20, 2011 that said that Tricare will be following the latest CMS billing guidelines for the 2011-2012 flu season. They have made the change retroactive back to January 1, 2011. It states as follows:\\n_\\n\\nCPT code 90658 (Influenza virus vaccine, split virus, when administered to individuals 3 years of age and older for intramuscular use) is currently not priced by TRICARE®. If this code is used for billing, the claim must be billed with the National Drug Code (NDC) number and it will be reimbursed at the NDC rate. If there is no NDC on the claim, it will be denied. If the 90658 is denied and an Q-code is appropriate, a corrected claim can be submitted.\\n\\n_\\nSo in other words the claim will be paid based on the manufacturer, since the NDC identifies the maker of the vaccine. If there is no NDC number, the claim now will be denied. This is as of 10/20/11 per Tricare but they are going back to 1/1/11. So based on what your rep stated to you, if claims were sent earlier this year without an NDC number and Tricare paid those claims then they would ask for their money back. I can see where the rep would have come up with that. However, Tricare has required the NDC number for quite some time and has denied claims if the NDC number was not submitted.\\nPlease post if you have more info or you hear more on this subject.

If you are asking what is the allowable charge that the insurance company will reimburse your for, well that depends on your contract with the individual carrier. If you are asking how much you are allowed to charge, then my answer would be you can charge anything you want to because what is not allowed by the insurance company will not be paid and you will have to write it off. In some cases such as Medicaid there may be an amount you are required to charge but that can vary from state to state.

If your patients do not currently have health insurance, refer them to www.HealthCare.gov to learn more about their healthcare coverage options. • Medicare – For patients 65 years of age or older enrolled in Medicare, Medicare Part B covers the cost of inﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccines, as well as hepatitis B vaccine for per-sons at increased risk of hepatitis B.\\nPatients with a Medi care Prescrip-tion Drug Plan (Part D) or who are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage Plan (Part C) that offers Medicare prescription drug coverage may also have coverage for additional vaccines like zoster and Tdap.

It also explains how innova-tive bill ing techniques, when combined with chart reminders, standing orders, and other methods of standardizing your oﬃce operations, can substan-tially reduce the costs of administering vaccinations in your oﬃce. Additional information on improving immunization rates in your practice is found in IAC’s Strategies to Improve Adult Vaccination Cover-age, available at www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2050.pdf, as well as on the immuni -zation websites for the Ameri can College of Physi-cians (http://immunization.\\nacponline.org) and other medical associations and organ izations listed in Step 7A: Financial Considerations. Later in this section you can ﬁnd the codes you will need to bill. (Table 3: Immuniza-tion Codes Used to Bill Medicare and Table 4: Immu-nization Codes Used to Bill Third-Party Payers.) Billing Medicare for immunizations Medicare Part B covers the cost of inﬂuenza and pneumococcal (both PPSV23 and PCV13) vaccines, as well as hepatitis B vaccine for persons at increased risk of hepatitis B. Medicare Part B does not cover other vaccinations unless they are directly related to the treatment of an injury or direct exposure to a dis-ease or condition, such as anti-rabies treatment, tetanus antitoxin, and Td/Tdap for wound manage-ment. Therefore, in the absence of injury or direct exposure, preventive immunization against diseases such as pertussis, diphtheria, etc., is not covered under Medicare Part B. These vaccines and other commercially available vaccines (such as zoster) typically are covered by Medicare Part D drug plans when they are ACIP-recommended to prevent ill-ness. Billing for Part D vaccines goes directly to the third-party drug coverage plan.\\nThough not reimbursed directly through the Medi -care Physician Fee Schedule, the administration of inﬂuenza, pneumococcal, and hepatitis B vac-cines (HCPCS codes G0008, G0009, and G0010) is reimbursed at the same rate as CPT code 90471 for the year that corresponds to the date of service of the claim.\\nVaccinating Adults: A Step-by-Step Guide Immunization Action Coalition • www.immunize.org • www.vaccineinformation.org 108 step ⁷b: How to Bill for Adult Immunizations Innovative billing techniques, when combined with chart reminders, standing orders, and other methods of standardizing your oﬃce operations, can substantially reduce the costs of administering vaccinations in your oﬃce.\\nSaint Paul, Minnesota t 651-647-9009 t www.immunize.org t www.vaccineinformation.org www.immunize.org/catg.d/p2050.pdf t Item #P2050 (9/17) An unequivocal provider recommendation is crucial.\\nt\\x01\\x01 One of the leading reasons adults identify for not receiving a vaccine is the lack of a recommen-dation from their provider. t\\x01\\x01 An unequivocal vaccine recommendation by an adult’s healthcare provider is one of the most important interventions to improve patient acceptance of a vaccine. t\\x01\\x01 Providers often don’t appreciate the power of their recommendation of a vaccine, or the impact of their lack of a recommendation.

Low adult vaccination coverage rates occur for a variety of reasons, including low community demand for vaccines, lack of access to vaccination services, and system- and provider-related factors. Successful adult vaccination delivery depends on several patient and provider factors, as well as system issues, such as vaccine supply and reimbursement. Adults are unlikely to seek vaccination unless they believe that the disease is a threat to them and that there is a vaccine that can prevent the disease. They need to know that they are personally at risk. Even if they know a vaccine is available, adults also may have misconceptions about the vaccine and inordinate concerns about vaccine adverse reactions. $\\x03NQRZOHGJHDEOH\\x03SURYLGHU\\x03ZKR\\x03XVHV\\x03HƪHFWLYH\\x03VWUDWHJLHV\\x03 OLNH\\x03WKH\\x03RQHV\\x03VXJJHVWHG\\x03EHORZ\\x03FDQ\\x03DGGUHVV\\x03WKHVH\\x03LVVXHV\\x11 effective strategies Unequivocal provider recommendation Standing orders protocols Reminder and recall systems Assessment and feedback Expansion of patient access www.immunize.org/ catg.d/p2050.pdf 108 Billing Medicare for additional services When administering inﬂuenza, pneumococcal, and/or hepatitis B vaccines, you may bill for addi-tional reasonable and necessary services. For example, you can bill HCPCS G0008 for adminis-tering inﬂuenza vaccine and also bill for other serv-ices performed during the same visit, including an evaluation and management (E&M) service. Each additional service should always be justiﬁed with an appropriate diagnosis code.\\nHowever, if you use “roster billing” (see below), you should not list additional services on the ros-ter bill. All other covered services, including oﬃce visits, are subject to more comprehensive data requirements; you should bill them using normal Part B claims ﬁling procedures and forms.\\nRoster billing (Inﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccinations only) The simpliﬁed roster billing process was developed to enable Medicare beneﬁciaries to participate in mass pneumococcal and inﬂuenza vaccination pro-grams. (Note: Medicare has not developed roster billing for hepatitis B or any other vaccinations.) Roster billing also can substantially lessen the admin-istrative burden on physician practices by allowing them to submit one claim for all of the Medicare beneﬁciaries that received either pneumococcal or inﬂuenza vaccines on a given day. Medicare will often refer to providers who utilize roster billing as “mass immunizers.” For Medicare Part B submissions, physician prac-tices and other mass immunizers must submit a separate preprinted CMS-1500 paper claim form or bill electronically for each type of vaccination (either inﬂuenza or pneumococcal) and attach a roster bill containing information for two or more Medicare beneﬁciaries. When mass immunizers choose to conduct roster billing electronically, they are required to use the HIPAA-adopted ASC X12N 837 claim standard. Local Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) may offer low or no-cost software to help providers utilize roster billing electronically. How-ever, this software is not currently available nation-wide, so check with your local MAC for speciﬁcs in your area.\\nAll entities that submit claims on roster bills must accept assignment, meaning they must agree to accept the amount that Medicare allows as the total payment. Roster bills submitted by providers to a MAC must contain at least two patients’ names, and the date of service for each vaccination admin-istered must be the same. For additional information on roster billing, see the CMS document Mass Immuniz-ers and Roster Billing: Simpli-ﬁed Billing for Inﬂuenza Virus and Pneumo coccal Vac-cinations at www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/ Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/ downloads/Mass_Immunize_Roster_Bill_factsheet_ ICN907275.pdf.\\nVaccinating Adults: A Step-by-Step Guide Immunization Action Coalition • www.immunize.org • www.vaccineinformation.org step ⁷b: How to Bill for Adult Immunizations 109 Roster billing also can substantially lessen the administrative burden on physician practices by allowing them to submit one claim for all of the Medicare beneﬁciaries that received either pneumo coccal or inﬂuenza vaccines on a given day.\\n109 Vaccinating Adults: A Step-by-Step Guide Immunization Action Coalition • www.immunize.org • www.vaccineinformation.org 110 step ⁷b: How to Bill for Adult Immunizations Table 1: CMS-1500 Form To further minimize the administrative burden of roster billing, providers can pre-print the following blocks on a modiﬁed CMS-1500 form: 110 Information that can be preprinted on form X in “Medicare” block “See Attached Roster” “None” X in “No” block Enter Z23 Line 1: “60” Line 2: “60” ALL entities should use POS code “60” for roster billing.

If your sys-tem is unable to accept a line item charge of 0.00 for an immunization service, do not key the line item. Likewise, Electronic Media Claim (EMC) billers should submit line items for free immunization services on EMC pneumo -coccal or inﬂuenza vaccination claims only if their system accepts them.\\nX in “Yes” block “$0.00” Signature of physician or entity’s representative Enter the name, address, and zip code of the location where service was provided NPI of the service facility Billing provider information and phone number NPI of the billing provider or group Block # 1 2 Patient’s Name 11 Insured’s Policy Group or FECA # 20 Outside Lab?\\n21 Diagnosis or Nature of Illness or Injury 24B Place of Service (POS) 24D Procedure, Services, or Supplies 24E Diagnosis Pointer (Code) 24F Charges 27 Accept Assignment?\\n29 Amount Paid 31 Signature of Physician or Supplier 32 Service Facility Location Information 32a 33 Billing Provider Info and Phone # 33a A separate CMS-1500 for each type of vaccination must have an attached roster that includes the following information: • Provider’s name and identiﬁcation number (NPI) • Date of service • Control number for the MAC • Beneﬁciary/patient: – Health insurance claim number (HICN) – Name and address – Date of birth – Sex – Signature or stamped “signature on ﬁle” A “signature on ﬁle” stamp or notation qualiﬁes as a signature on a roster claim form in cases where the provider has a signed authorization to bill Medicare for services on ﬁle in the beneﬁciary’s record (e.g., when the vaccine is administered in a physician’s oﬃce).\\nThe MAC can modify the format of the roster bill to meet the needs of individual providers. The MAC has the responsibility to develop suitable ros-ter bill formats that meet provider and MAC needs and contain the minimum data necessary to satisfy processing requirements for these claims.\\nnote: The roster bills for inﬂuenza and pneumo-coccal vaccinations are not identical. Pneumococcal rosters must contain the following language: Warning: Beneﬁciaries must be asked if they have received a pneumococcal vaccination.\\n●Rely on patient’s memory to determine prior vaccination status. Providing free immunizations The majority of vaccinations administered to Med-icare beneﬁciaries in private practice will be docu-mented (e.g., in the oﬃce medical record and per-haps an immuniza-tion registry) and a bill submitted for payment. However, practices some-times waive part or all of their fees due to a patient’s inability to pay or for other reasons. Also, some practices may spon-sor health fairs where they provide free vaccinations to the public as part of their marketing efforts to attract new patients. If you give vaccines to Medicare beneﬁciaries free of charge, you must adhere to the following: You may bill Medicare for vaccines administered to Medicare beneﬁciaries even if you render services free of charge to non-Medicare beneﬁciaries. How-ever, your administration fee cannot be billed to Medicare if you typically administer vaccines at no cost to non-Medicare beneﬁciaries. For vaccines purchased through a CDC vaccine purchase contract, Vaccinating Adults: A Step-by-Step Guide Immunization Action Coalition • www.immunize.org • www.vaccineinformation.org step ⁷b: How to Bill for Adult Immunizations 111 Practices sometimes waive part or all of their fees due to a patient’s inability to pay or for other reasons.\\nTable 2: Medicare Billing Policy Can Medicare be billed for providing the same service to Medicare beneﬁciaries?\\nNo Yes* *However, providers may not charge Medicare beneﬁciaries more than non-Medicare patients for vaccines or administration Provider’s policy for providing vaccines to NON-Medicare patients Vaccine administered free of charge, regardless of patient’s ability to pay Vaccine administered at no/reduced charge for patients of limited means, but provider expects to be paid if patient’s health insurance covers vaccinations 111 regardless of whether federal, state, or local funds are being used, you may bill and expect payment from Medicare for the administration cost only.\\nGovernment providers must follow a separate set of Medicare requirements if they administer vacci-nations in a facility operated by a federal, state, or local health department, such as a public health clinic. Private providers also must follow a sepa rate set of requirements if they administer vaccines provided by a federal, state, or local government.\\nCentralized billing The centralized billing process was developed to ease the admin-istrative burden for very large institutions with mass immuniza-tion sites scat-tered throughout the country (e.g., large healthcare networks covering multiple states, and national pharmacy chains). Centralized billing allows such institutions (i.e., mass immunizers) to send all claims for inﬂuenza and pneumo coccal vaccinations to a single MAC for payment, regard-less of the geographic locality in which the vaccina-tion was administered. The cost of administering inﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccinations will be reimbursed per the Medicare Physician Fee Sched-ule (MPFS) for the appropriate locality. The cost of vaccines will be reimbursed per Medicare’s stan-dard method for reimbursing drugs and biologicals.\\nThis is based on the lower of charges or 95 percent of the Average Wholesale Price (AWP). (For more speciﬁcs about Centralized Billing, contact your local MAC. Contact information may be found at https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Provider-Enrollment -and-Certiﬁcation/MedicareProviderSupEnroll/ downloads/contact_list.pdf.)

Should I bill the 8 codes with or with the QW modifier to Medicare? Please Help!\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nApril 21, 2016 at 12:39 pm\\nYou only need the QW modifier for the CLIA waived tests done in the office. No need to put the QW in the office or the venipuncture.\\nHowever I don’t believe the test you listed are not waived tests and thus a QW modifier is not appropriate. Are you doing these in the office? Sending them to an outside lab?\\n85025 Complete Blood Count, with differential WBC\\n80053 Comprehensive Metabolic Panel\\n80061 Lipid Panel\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCarole Sawyer\\nMarch 28, 2015 at 8:46 am\\nMedicare is requiring a modifier for flu vaccine Q2035. I cannot find which modifier to code with this vaccine. The rejection code if CO4.

There are several that produce the vaccine including, GlaxoSmithKine, Sanofi Pasteur, MedImmune, Protein Sciences Corp, bioCSI, Novartis and ID Biomedical.\\nTheir vaccines are marketed under the brand names Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, Fluvirin, Flucelvax, Flublok, Fluzone and Fluzone High-Dose\\nThen you need to know if the vaccine is preservative free becasue there is a different if it is. On top of that is the vaccine trivalent or quadrivalent, protecting against 3 or 4 strains of influenza.\\nBased on you the info you provided and given that pre-filled syringes are usually preservative free, it could be one of two CPT codes listed below.\\n90656 Influenza virus vaccine, trivalent, split virus, preservative free, when administered to individuals 3 years and older, for intramuscular use\\n90686 Influenza virus vaccine, quadrivalent, split virus, preservative free, when administered to individuals 3 years of age and older, for intramuscular use\\nThe diagnosis code we typically use is V04.81, Need for prophylactic vaccination and\\ninoculation, Influenza.\\nAlso don’t forget that you may need the NDC number to get paid by some insurance companies. You should find that in the package insert for the vaccine. Use the 11 digit format. Sometimes they only provide 10 digits and you have to convert it to 11 by adding a zero in the appropriate location in the code.\\nHopefully this info will point you in the write direction. Make sure to check your coding books and with your insurance carriers on how they want the vaccine billed.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTina\\nFebruary 6, 2012 at 1:40 pm\\nI have submitted G0008 and Q2038. They also had a 99214 visit for different reason. Medicare is not paying G0008 with reason codes COB15 and M80. I never had a problem with getting paid for administration before. Pleas help.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nFebruary 7, 2012 at 4:51 pm\\nWe frequently bill problem visits with the flu vaccine and administration and have not had any issues getting reimbursement for all three line items you’ve indicated above. Did you append modifier -25 to the office visit? If not we recommend you resubmit the claim with the 99214-25. This should alleviate the reimbursement issue. Also make sure that the referring physician is indicated (even for our family practice we have to put in the referring physician – we use the actual PCP even if it is one of our own doctors) because otherwise the claim will be denied for missing/invalid information.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDiane\\nJanuary 17, 2012 at 7:55 pm\\nWhen billing Medicare we use the CPT G0008. Should we also use the CPT codes 90471 without office visit and 90460 visits with office visit?\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\nManny Oliverez\\nJanuary 17, 2012 at 8:16 pm\\nDiane thanks for your question. There is only one administration code for Medicare flu shots and that is G0008. CPT Code 90471 or 90460 would not be used for the flu admin code for Medicare. Also just an FYI, 90471 may be appropriate without an office visit but 90460 may not be appropriate even if there is an office visit.\\nReply\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndr.venkatesh\\nNovember 11, 2011 at 2:20 pm\\nDear Mr. Oliverez,\\nI billed medicare for Flu vaccine with Q2036 and G0008.

I looked up the denial reason codes and they really don’t make much sense for a flu shot. What ICD-9 code are you using?
